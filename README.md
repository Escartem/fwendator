# How to use

1) open [discord](https://discord.com/app) on your browser
2) open the devtools with `F12` or `ctrl + shift + i`
3) go to the console tab and paste this [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Escartem/fwendator/master/getFriends.min.js)

(I am aware that discord will show many warnings about not pasting random code into the console, and they are right, you can check this code by looking at the [original file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Escartem/fwendator/master/getFriends.js), and if you still don't trust it, just don't paste it)

4) after pasting it and running it, it should start processing your friends, now you just need to wait

5) once it's done, you should have a page showing the generated data, and a button to download it, you just need to click on it

6) now you need to clone this repo (with `git clone https://github.com/Escartem/fwendator` for example) and make sure you have both python and pyvis version 0.3.1 installed (with `pip install pyvis==0.3.1`)
7) run the python file with `python graph.py`, it will ask you to choose a .json file, select the one you downloaded earlier, and then the script should finish and generate a webpage in the `output` folder
8) and now you just need to open `nx.html` in that folder and you can explore your friends graph :D
